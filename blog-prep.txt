    - "It's so common now to use click handlers instead of submit handlers" ~ Westbrook
        - Delve into the A11y differences here and

    - Replace all inline code with handler methods
    - No need to sync input properties on input with HTML Element vs React element
        - React has to change state every input, whereas WC doesn't
    - Passing methods as parameters
